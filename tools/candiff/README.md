# Candiff

![](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

The `candiff` crate provides the `candiff` CLI tool.

The `candiff` tool compares candid data, and gives with human-readable output.

Rather than compare two values textually, the tool is structural, like Candid itself.

See `design/` for more.
